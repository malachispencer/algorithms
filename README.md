# Algorithms and Data Structures

Here you will find notable algorithms and data structures in computer science.

While this repository is fairly lightweight, in my [Codewars repository](https://github.com/malachispencer/codewars) you can find many more algorithms used directly to solve Codewars kata.

My Codewars repository contains solutions for almost 300 Codewars kata.
