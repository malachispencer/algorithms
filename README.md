# Algorithms

Here you will find notable algorithms in computer science.

All but decimal-to-binary.js feature full explanations of the algorithm and code.

While this repository is fairly lightweight, in my [Codewars repository](https://github.com/malachispencer/codewars) you can find a many more algorithms used directly to solve Codewars kata.

The Codewars repository contains solutions for almost 300 Codewars kata.
